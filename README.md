Updated the wiring picture with new pictures of both boards to make wiring easier to understand

The new V8 tool shows you which com ports are
currently in use, it will change if you unplug 
then replug the TTL adapter
***********************************************************

The new version only asks for the com port once and stores
the value in system environment and then removes it once 
finished.
